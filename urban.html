        <p>Next time you're in the lower Manhattan SoHo area, check out Miss Lily's for an authentic Caribbean meal. You won't be disappointed. With rhythmic feels courtesy of the awesome DJ and its lowkey vibe, you'll be telling your friends about it. And if you're up for it, you can go on a shopping spree just a few blocks away. (Editor's Note: Be sure to make a reservation in advance, it'll help reduce your waiting time - you can thank me later)</p>
